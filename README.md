## About Me
My name is Chaz, I am 24 years old, and I am learning to code. --- I want a career to be where I want to be in my life and due to my love of computers and creation I've decided computer science and all of its bouts are the best path for me. I'm a fast learner and I am well versed in math so I don't believe it will be too much of a challenge. I've been on this journey for a few years and I've hit a few roadbloacks but now ==I am going to go all the way this time== and work on projects as quickly as I feel comfortable. They may not be the best projects and some of them may be out of reach for my current skill level but I'll figure that out as I go.
